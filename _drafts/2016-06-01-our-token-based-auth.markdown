Token-based authentication at E2N
=================================

The vast blogosphere of software development is full of articles about
languages, frameworks and why A or B is better or worse for a given task. Yet I
often find a lack of detail on the actual: How did you do this?
there is often a lack of detail. Often I find myself thinking "Yes! That is
nice, but show me how!" Let us focus less on the building blocks and more on
the internal wiring that keeps the software together!

One thing that has often bugged me in the vast blogosphere of software
development is that we spend a lot of time talking about frameworks, but not
about software architecture. I am curious about *how* people apply frameworks
and not what framekworks they use.  Not everyone is willing to show the
internal wirings that keeps the software together.  


Background
----------
One of the 



Requirements
------------
* Easy to understand, implement and extend
* Support heterogeneous clients: from browsers to smartphones apps and even
  command-line applications


Flow
----

Pros

Cons
----
There is code repetition in every stored procedure. Even though it is just a
couple lines, it violates DRY.

Cookies are awkward to use. I would prefer a simple HTTP-header. now


Conclusion
----------
This is also my first attempt in what I believe is Open-source software
architecture. askdj lasjdf ljaslfk salkdfjasl kdfjsalkdfj sldfjsalk

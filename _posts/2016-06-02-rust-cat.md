Starting with a new programming language is always hard. I decided
to give me some exercises to get a grip of the language. 

My very first rust programm is a simple clone of `cat`.

Assignment
----------

Write a program in rust that prints the contents of a file
to stdout.

Solution
--------

Below is the solution I came up with. Can't tell if its good or not at
this very moment, but at least it compiles and runs.

    use std::env;
    use std::io::prelude::*;
    use std::fs::File;

    fn main() {
        let args = env::args();
        let file = args.skip(1).next().unwrap();

        let mut fh = File::open(file).unwrap(); 
        let mut buf = String::new();

        fh.read_to_string(&mut buf).unwrap();

        println!("{}", buf);
    }

What I learned
--------------

Learning exception handling in Rust was probably the difficult part.
It did not expect to get confronted with it early.

Other notable things:

+ std::env
+ basic io
+ [E0308]
+ Looking up Rust on SO, because I had no clue what is happening
